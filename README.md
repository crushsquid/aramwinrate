# ARAM Winrate Calculator

Currently aram_winrate.py is a script that when run will output a csv with winrates on various champs in aram. Examples can be seen in data/. This will likely be turned into a website where users can enter their username and see this information in their browser.

Can be run by: `python aram_winrate.py [username] [number of games]`

Currently the command line script will assume the user is from NA. If you would like to run this and you are from a different region change "constants.REGION_NA" near the bottom to whichever region you are from.
